In this article, I would like to present you with a simple, yet very effective approach for testing your Spring Data repositories using the Spock framework. For the purposes of this article, I will be using the Spring Data Neo4j module to create our simple DAO and repository and Gradle for handling our dependencies. I will be covering a basic Spock testing features as well as a basic project setup to test out our application. To follow along, you will need to have access to a Neo4j database.

## Why Spock?

Spock is a very useful framework for testing your application - it has a very simple, Groovy-based syntax, providing its user with much more flexibility when it comes down to creating test cases and checking its results.

## Project setup

For all the people new to the subject, I will now show you how to create a sample Spring Boot project for our testing purposes. Feel free to skip the following sections if you are already familiar with the spring setup process.

### Create your Spring Boot project

In order to create your project, head over to the [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io/) website. You will be asked to select adequate options for your project - just as shown on the image below.
For now, ignore the dependencies section. Feel free to change the following options such as the Java version according to your needs.

Next, press the Generate button - this will initiate a download of a .zip archive containg all of the necessary files for this sample project. Unpack the archive in a location of your choice. 

### Add dependencies

Once you're done unpacking the archive, head over to the root directory of your project and open the `build-gradle` file. Here, you would want to add some dependencies for our project. 
Inside the `dependencies` section add the following:
- `implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-data-neo4j'` - this will allow us to create models of Neo4j nodes and repositories.

### Estabilish a connection with your database

Head over to `src/main/resources` and open the `application.properties` file. Here, you will need to define your database's address and credentials for estabilishing a connection. You will need access to a running database for this step.

The file should look somewhat like this:
```
spring.neo4j.uri=<your bolt address>
spring.neo4j.authentication.username=<your username>
spring.neo4j.authentication.password=<your password>
```

### Create a simple Data Access Object (DAO)

Before creating a repository, you need a model of the repository's contents - for this example, start creating a simple Person DAO. Inside the `src/main/java` folder create a new file `Word.java`:

Make sure to create:
- a getter and a setter for the `word` field
- `hashCode()` and `equals()` methods for future comparisons of the objects

Note that there is no need to create any constructors.

Your Word.java file should look somewhat like this:

```
import org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.schema.Id;
import org.springframework.data.neo4j.core.schema.Node;
import java.util.Objects;

@Node
public class Word
{
    @Id
    private String word;

    public String getWord()
    {
        return word;
    }

    public void setWord(String word)
    {
        this.word = word;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o)
    {
        if (this == o) return true;
        if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
        Word word1 = (Word) o;
        return Objects.equals(getWord(), word1.getWord());
    }

    @Override
    public int hashCode()
    {
        return Objects.hash(getWord());
    }
}

```

### Create a simple Word repository:
Next, create a simple repository model for our Word entity with two simple methods. In order to do that, let's create a new Java Interface, which extends the `Neo4JRepository<Word, String>` interface. This will provide us with all the necessary methods to interact with the database. Just like in the previous step, create a new WordRepository.java file. Here's the code:

```
import org.springframework.data.neo4j.repository.Neo4jRepository;

public interface WordRepository extends Neo4jRepository<Word, String> { }
```

Now, you should be ready to start creating tests for our sample application.


## Testing with Spock

### Dependencies
In order to use the Spock framework, you have to edit the `build-gradle` file once more to add missing dependencies. Inside the `dependencies` section add the following dependencies:
- `testImplementation 'org.spockframework:spock-core:2.0-groovy-3.0'`
- `testImplementation 'org.spockframework:spock-spring:2.0-groovy-3.0'`

### Creating the test class

Head over to `src/test`. Here, you will need to create a `groovy` subdirectory, and inside it create a file called `WordRepositoryTest.groovy`. In order for the class to be recognized as a Spock test, it needs to extend the `Specification` class - this will enable the framework to automatically run our test methods. To mark it as a Spring Test class, just add a `@SpringBootTest(classes=TestDemoApplication.class)` annotation. Be careful when passing the class argument, as it could be named differently in your project.

Our tests will surely alter the contents of the database in some way or another - luckily, there is a very simple way to avoid it - you will need to add a `@Transactional` annotation - this will make sure not to commit any changes inside the repository.

Next, let's add a WordRepository private field and annotate it with an `@Autowired` annotation - this will let us interact with the database and test out our methods.


Here's how the class should look by now:

```
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired
import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest
import org.springframework.transaction.annotation.Transactional
import spock.lang.Specification

@Transactional
@SpringBootTest(classes=TestDemoApplication.class)
class WordRepositoryTest extends Specification 
{
    @Autowired
    private WordRepository repository;
}
```

Now you are ready to finally write your first Spock test.

### Basic syntax

Unlike Java, each Spock class's method starts with a `def` keyword, followed by the methods name - this simplifies the process of creating tests and makes the code look cleaner.

### Before a test

With Spock, there is an option to create a setup method that will prepare te repository for an upcoming test. This method will automatically execute before running any of the test cases. In order to use this feature, you need to implement a `setup()` method. In this case, the setup method will delete all the entries from the repository before each test using the `deleteAll()` method. 

Here's what the method looks like:

```
def setup()
{
   repository.deleteAll()
}
```

### Simple test method

Let's create a method to test out if it is possible to add a new Word object into the database and then to retrieve it.

In spock, first thing to do is to name the method accordingly so that it describes what the tests is going to be about. Unlike in java, after the previously mentioned `def` keyword you can define the methods name in double quotes. 

Here is an example:

```
def "A word can be stored and retrieved from the database"() {}
```

A Spock test method contains two sections: `when:` and `then:`. The former is used for the setup of our test case, the latter checks if specified conditions have been met. Let's create a new `Word` object, assign it some value, add it to the repository and then see, if a call to the repository's `findAll()` method returns a single object with the same value as the one that you have created. 

Here is the complete method:
```
def "A word can be stored and retrieved from the database"()
{
	when:
		Word word = new Word();
		word.setWord("Test");
		repository.save(word);

	then:
		repository.findAll().size() == 1;
		repository.findAll().get(0) == word;
}
```

In Spock, the conditions don't need to be separated by a `&&` operator - this is thanks to the `then` keyword which automatically expects logical expressions.

And this is it. In order to run the tests, use the `gradlew build` command, which should automatically execute all of the tests.

## Conclusions

Unit testing repositories with Spock is a very simple process - thanks to Groovy, the syntax is very easy to learn and makes creating test cases less cumbersome when compared to other popular frameworks. This guide only scratches the surface of Spock's full capabilities - I strongly recommend to read more about it over at [Spock's official documentation](https://spockframework.org/spock/docs/1.1/all_in_one.html) as it has a lot more to offer.
